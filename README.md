# hello-world
This is my first repository in Github.
I have known this website for a while, but I didn't really use it. Now I plan to use Github to learn new things like progamming and writing.
Thanks to Mr Wang Pei, I learnt a lot from his website GC4.camp

Today feel not good about myself, no particular purpose,no good action, no good results.
